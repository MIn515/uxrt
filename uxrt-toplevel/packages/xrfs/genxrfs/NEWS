Changes in release 1.0:

* Complete rewrite in Rust with a new format that uses a purely MBI-based 
  directory (the old file headers are retained in a stripped-down form that only
  contains Unix-specific metadata not included in the MBI
  - The MBI tag types present in the old version are retained, and a few new
    types have been added to handle metadata and special files
  - Support for padding compaction wasn't carried over, since the entire image 
    is expected to be compressed instead if it is being loaded into RAM (no 
    specific support in XRFS is required for this)

* Initial release.
