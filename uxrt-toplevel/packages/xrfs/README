XRFS is a minimalist read-only filesystem with execute-in-place support,
intended mainly for use in boot images. It is based on a modified version of the
Multiboot2 header (which allows bootloaders and kernels to handle it with 
Multiboot2 code instead of having to incorporate a completely separate driver)

This package contains libraries and utilities for XRFS under UX/RT as well as
other operating systems.

Contents:

genxrfs/             Utility for building XRFS images
mkbootimage          Wrapper for genxrfs to build XRFS images from file lists
mount_xrfs_uxrt/     mount_xrfs program for UX/RT
xrfslib/             Static library for reading XRFS images


The layout of the filesystem is the following:
